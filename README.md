# Sortable-demo

A demonstration of how to do drag-n-drop sorting of Ember records using JQuery
UI's Sortable plugin. Described in detail on my website:

http://www.20papercups.net/programming/drag-n-drop-sorting-with-ember-2-x-and-jquery-ui/

Based on the work of Benjamin Rhodes, as described here:
